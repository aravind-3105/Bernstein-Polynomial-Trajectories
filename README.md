# Robotics: Planning & Navigation: Assignment 2A

Fitting Bernstein polynomials to non-holonomic robot trajectories.

In `mkmovie.sh` enter the path to the directory where the snapshots are stored and edit the name of the simulation. For example, if my simulation screenshots are stored in the directory `nonhn_tree/`, I will run the following command:

`ffmpeg -r 2 -f image2 -i nonhn_tree/snap%d.png -s 1000x1000 -pix_fmt yuv420p -y simulation.mp4`
